# 🧩 My LeetCode Solutions

*Because nothing says "I'm a programmer" like optimizing solutions that run in milliseconds while drinking concerning amounts of coffee.*

## 📋 What's This All About?

Welcome to my algorithmic playground! This repository houses my solutions to various LeetCode problems as I journey through the wonderful (and occasionally frustrating) world of coding challenges. Whether you're here to compare approaches, steal—I mean, borrow—ideas, or just see how someone else tackled these problems, make yourself at home!

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each problem has its own dedicated folder named with the problem number and title (e.g., `1-two-sum`). Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **README.md**: Contains the original problem statement with examples
- **[problem-name].java**: My solution with runtime and memory usage stats

Problems are organized sequentially by their LeetCode number, making it easy to locate specific challenges.

## 🎯 My Solution Collection

Here's a taste of what you'll find:

- **Array Manipulation**: Problems like Two Sum (#1), Product of Array Except Self (#238)
- **String Operations**: Valid Palindrome (#125), Reverse Words in a String (#151)
- **Tree Traversal**: Same Tree (#100), Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (#104)
- **Linked Lists**: Merge Two Sorted Lists (#21), Linked List Cycle (#141)
- **Dynamic Programming**: Climbing Stairs (#70), Minimum Path Sum (#64)
- **Graph Problems**: Course Schedule (#207)

## 💡 Performance Stats

My solutions typically include performance metrics like:
```
Time: 3 ms (65.29%) | Memory: 45 MB (58.53%)
```
This shows how the solution performs compared to other submissions (percentile ranking).

## 🚀 My Progress

I'm steadily working through the LeetCode problem set, with a current focus on:
- Data structures fundamentals
- Graph algorithms
- Dynamic programming techniques

## 🔍 How to Use This Repository

1. Browse problems by their number
2. Check the README in each folder for the problem statement
3. Review my Java implementation
4. Compare your approach with mine
5. Suggest improvements (if you see a way to optimize further!)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions pass all LeetCode test cases, but may not be the most optimal for every scenario. The beauty of programming is that there are multiple ways to solve the same problem. If you spot a more elegant solution, I'd love to hear about it!

## 📈 Learning Journey

This repository tracks my algorithmic growth. Earlier solutions might be less optimized than later ones—that's part of the learning process! As the great philosopher LeetCode once said, "The journey of a thousand Runtime Errors begins with a single misplaced semicolon."
